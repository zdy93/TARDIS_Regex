# TARDIS_Regex
This work is to extend the [TARDIS](https://github.com/lzhang6/TARDIS) to support the query with regular expression (range of values)
Details of requirements and usage is in [this](https://github.com/lzhang6/TARDIS). The only thing different is that you need to use the
config.conf in this repository, no the one in the original TARDIS repository.
